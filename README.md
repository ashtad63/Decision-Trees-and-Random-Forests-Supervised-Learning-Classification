# Decision Trees and Random Forests (RF) Supervised Learning Classification

The **Seed** dataset contains seven real, continuous independent variables (the predictors) and another column that specifies \
the class of the seed, the dependent, response variable. There are seven measurements taken from each of 210 seed kernels, \
70 from each of three species of wheat - **Canadian, Kama,** and **Rosa.** 

 We will use **Decision Trees** and **Random Forests** to predict the classification of the seeds.
